# Management-Library
The code represents a simple library management system implemented in C programming language.

**Project Overview:**
The Library Management System project was developed three years ago to facilitate the management of a library's book inventory and user information. The system allows librarians to perform various tasks such as adding, searching, viewing, and deleting books, as well as updating user credentials.

**File Structure:**
- **main.c**: Contains the main source code of the project, including function definitions and the main function.
- **LibBookS.bin**: Binary file used to store book information.
- **README.md**: This file, providing project documentation and instructions.

**Features:**
1. **User Authentication**: Users are required to log in using predefined credentials.
2. **Add Books**: Allows librarians to add new books to the library inventory.
3. **Search Books**: Enables users to search for books by their title.
4. **View Books**: Displays a list of all books available in the library.
5. **Delete Books**: Allows librarians to remove books from the inventory.
6. **Update Credentials**: Users can update their login credentials.
